>[!pf2rule]+ Sylvanor the Wild Warden
>The Emerald Monarch and the Keeper of the Montains, Sylvanor is the patron of Forest, Beasts, Montain, and everything that is wild. They are portrayed as a strong hooded hunter with braided long hair and wearing green and brown hunting clothes, mounting a giant white tiger or a eight-legged wolf. There's not a common consensus on Sylvanor's gender, some believing it to be fluid as the wind.
