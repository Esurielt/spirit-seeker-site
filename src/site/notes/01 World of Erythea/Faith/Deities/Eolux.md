>[!pf2rule]+ Eolux the Defying Trickster
>The Patron of Paradox and the Mythic Maverick. Eolux is the patron of Trickery, Chaos, Charm, and Freedom. Eolux is prayed to by rebels and unconventional opportunists. While Eolux does not have an organized religion, they often have hidden shrines and many songs in their name. Eolux is often portrayed as a carefree androgynous figure with long hair, two red horns or fox-like ears; he often wears black and red garbs in contrast to the royal colors of red and white.
