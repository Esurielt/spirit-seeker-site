#### The Driven Inheritors
Humans are the most prolific and ambitious of the mortal races inhabiting Erythea. As the shortest-lived of ancestries, they have an innate sense of urgency that drives their endeavors - whether chasing dreams of glory, building towering civilizations, or wallowing in melancholy. This volatile nature allows humans to deeply attune with the impassioned essences of spirits and magic.

#### Pantheon of Civilization
Chief among the human deities is Ashur, the Great Spirit of Cities and Law. He is revered as the patron of humanity's monumental nation-building across Erythea. On the continent of Ebolon, the mighty empires of Caelindor, Valcour, Pharousia, and Qahilim arose under Ashur's divine guidance, their ziggurats and citadels crafted in his name.

Yet humans also honor other Great Spirits as progenitors of their civilized virtues, especially the other two Great Spirits that was responsible for human's creation. Adonis, whose heart beats with compassion, is the beacon of healers and educators. Nabu the Scribe, oversees the vital abilities of record-keeping, commerce, and the written word that allow societies to flourish. 

#### A Diverging Path
In recent ages, it was human devotion and industry that triggered the Arcane Revolution, harnessing cerulium's power to birth wondrous magic-fueled infrastructure in metropolises like Azulihrun. Whether viewed as a miraculous boon or dangerous hubris, none can deny human passion and determination to unravel the arcane mysteries to improve their life and efficiency.

Yet not all humans have embraced the arcane path. Rural villages and nomadic tribes still follow the ancient ways, venerating the Great Spirits along with the local nature spirits, or eccentric new cults and mystic traditions borne of human willfulness. Some were pushed to the fringes of the society due to the restriction on their traditional practices, cast hatred on the false worship of the Great Spirits and the sciences, turn to seek power and comfort with dark occult entities instead. 

In crowded Azulihrun, the pious intermingle with scholars of reason, the wealthy oppress the destitute, and cultists embrace forbidden powers in shadowed corners. Humans contain multitudes - both pioneers and perpetrators, with inspirations and afflictions. Their destinies always seems unwritten, for good or ill.
