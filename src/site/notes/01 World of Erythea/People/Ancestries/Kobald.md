Forged by Caelithra and Eridius from the sorrow of the lost dragon lineage, Kobalds are the cunning, proud dragonkin native to Erythea's Northern mountains and the Shattered Isles. Long ago, in the First Age, dragons were a lineage of fey creatures shaped in the glorious image of Caelithra's family. But after the cataclysmic Fey Reckoning, these majestic beings dwindled, leaving Caelithra to mourn their passing. From her sorrow and Eridius's sympathy sprang the Kobalds, imbued with the legacies and affinities of their draconic ancestors.

Kobalds can look similar to human, has scale covered body, dragon tails, and horns. Dragonic legacies affect each clans of Kobalds slightly differently, as different clans of dragons looks wildly different from one another. Inheritors of draconic fire magics, their souls burn with Caelithra's blazing might. Kobalds wield a deep connection to the fires and a natural incline for chaotic and destructive magic. 

Kobalds' culture flourishes in connected subterranean lairs connected by networks of caverns. More than mere delvers of mountains, they are masterful underground gardeners tending to vast underground gardens overflowing with rare fungi, vibrant mosses, and ethereal bioluminescent flora that illuminate their cavern realms with a dreamlike phosphorescence. 

Because of Eridius's blessing and curiosity toward the Dragonic culture, Kobalds are also historians without peer, with venerable elders as living libraries safeguarding primordial lore through intricate oral traditions. Their culture enshrines the excavation and preservation of relics from ancient civilizations as a sacred duty. Driven by the urge to uncover the myth of their draconic ancestors and other Fey civilizations, Kobald archeologist, historian, and scholars could be found traveling around the world. 

Central to their way of life is also the mystic bonds Kobalds forge with beast companions from a young age through prehistoric rituals, each clan specializing in different animal kinships. Kobalds does not replace their companion if their bonded beast was to perish. Their relationship with their animal companion symbolize the role of their draconic ancestors as the rulers of all beasts in the age long past. 

With the rise of the Arcane Revolution and the proliferation of Cerulium technology, it is easier than ever for the Kobald scholars to travel the world and unearth knowledge from ages long past. Many was drawn from their mountain home to migrate to various cultural centers in the vast land of Eblon. Azulihrun attracted Kobalds from all walks of life. Some put their natural mastery over fire to the Cerulium forges and arcane factories, some found enrichment in roles as archivists and researchers in the scholarly circles, while beast-bonded Kobalds roams the edges of the city as rangers, scouts, and beast handlers. A lot of Kobalds continue to favor cavernous dwellings, constructing bustling underground housing in old sewage and basements, turning them into lush greenhouse and beautiful communities.
