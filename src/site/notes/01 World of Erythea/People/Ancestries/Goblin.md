Birthed in the Second Age from the intermingled dreams of the primordial serpents Eoluxe and Caelithra, the feral goblin tribes emerged amid the jagged caverns and rock spires of the mighty Elderspine Mountains. In those harsh subterranean depths, they forged a unique anarchic civilization - a confederation of massive hive-cities and madcap markets known as Izbudar.

Here, the goblins embraced a vibrant meritocratic society, disdaining hereditary privilege or centralized rulership. Instead, those who proved their ingenuity as tinkers, artificers, and arcanists rose to temporary prestige as "big bosses" - their craftsman innovations and daring trickster exploits enshrined in raucous oral epics and tales spun by hobgoblin bards.

Izbudar's very settlements reflected this ethos of constantly creative upheaval, with territorial boundaries and markets shifting as new factions vied for control and influence through competitions of intricate machinery, insult duels, and daring heists against one another. No formal currency existed, with goblins instead embracing an ad-hoc barter system revolving around favors, debts, and barters - quality craftsmanship designated by the "makers' mark" seared into each creation.

Goblin sorcerers and arcanists did not follow the rigid principles of arcane magic, instead attunding themselves to the primal chaos of local fey spirits and the raw, primordial energies of Eoluxe and Caelithra's dreams. While goblinkind's ingenuity allowed them to experiment with shaping cerulium into their own volatile, wild contraptions, they remained disdainful of arcane technology divorced from an attuned mage's will.

This chaotic, irreverent lifestyle brought the goblins into frequent conflict with the more regimented civilizations of the "tall races" like the human nations of Valcour and Caelindor to the north. Drawn by the rich cerulium veins in the Elderspine needed to fuel their arcane industries, these kingdoms waged brutal wars to claim the goblin lands - enslaving thousands and spreading vicious stereotypes that painted the goblins as stupid, anarchic brutes.

Through tenacity, trickery, and clandestine alliances with the dwarven kingdom of Dorn, the goblins of Izbudar endured these offenses, though they were forced to abandon portions of their ancestral territories along the Jagged Coast. Those who failed to adapt or broke sacred debts were cast out - some falling into despair to become twisted outcasts dwelling in ramshackle refugee camps suffused by the corrupting influence of Starscourge and other abominable forces.

A lingering distrust towards the "civilized" tall races became deeply engrained in mainstream Izbudar culture. Yet in the mad, ingenious chaos of their anarchic marketplaces and ever-shifting territorries, goblin creativity, invention, and an irreverent lust for life also endured against all efforts to subjugate it.
