>[!pf2note] Dreamtouched Heritages
Dreamtouched are those whose lives are intertwined with the ethereal realms of the Spirits. Born in moments where the veil between reality and the spirit realm wavers, they bear the mark of the Great Spirits' dream. Whether through intense prayers, chance encounters, or dramatic spiritual experiences, they are imbued with a connection to the world beyond reality. This gift, known as Dreamtouch, transform their bearers fundamentally in exchange for insights to the forces unseen.

##### Nephilim
Nephilims are those who manifest otherworldly influences connected with powerful spirits or specific Great Spirits, often because of their or their ancestors' bargains or prayer. Nephilim appearances manifest differently for everyone - it could be a strange body feature like horns, a vibrant imprint or runes on their skin, unusual hair and eye colors, or other subtle changes.
