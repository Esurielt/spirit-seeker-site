#### Origin
According to ancient myths, the feline Felidae were first shaped from desert sands and amber brew by the paws of Ninurta the Ranger and Kirisha the Mother. Imbued with feline grace, curiosity, and a love of feasting and wanderlust, the catfolk quickly spread across the savannas and woodlands.

#### Nepharan Nomads
In the harsh deserts of Nebet, tribes of proud Felidae banded together with lizardfolk and other beast-kin and founded the nation of Nephara. This ancient nomadic civilization roamed the dunes, building secret and majestic temples to the nature spirits hiding in the shifting sands. 

The Nepharan warriors, both male and female, became renowned for their litheness and fearlessness in battle. Equipped with khopesh blades and elegant bows, they guarded the oasis-cities and caravans that were the lifeblood of the desert traders.

#### Woodland Wanderers
Not all Felidae roams the deserts, however. As naturally adaptable hunters, many Felidae made homes amid the forests of Ebolon and Aerawan. In the wild, Felidae villages cluster in cleverly-hidden aeries amongst the boughs. They provide safe havens for their kind between long stretches of wandering the Secret Paths - an ancient network of overgrown roads and glades that only the catfolk know.

#### Felidae in Azulihrun
In the great cities of the present age like Azulihrun, Felidae have integrated well as cunning messengers, street-performers, wardens and diplomats. Their inherent charm and curiosity make them keen interpreters of culture.

However, the confined urban landscapes leave many catfolk restless, longing for a return to the wilderness. Wandering Felidae cavaliers can be found joining barbaric cat-cults or seeking the elemental powers of the Nephara ancients to reclaim their feral roots.
