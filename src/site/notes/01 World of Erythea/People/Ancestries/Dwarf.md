#### The Dwellers of the Umbral Depth
Ever since the first age, the dwarves lived in vast underground kingdoms in the subterranean world now known as the Umbral Realm. Their cities were marvels of stonecraft, with massive carved hallways, galleries, forges, and throne rooms with no lack of precious gems. The dwarves paid little heed to the surface realms, content with their subterranean existence.

That all changed when wandering fey refugees stumbled into the Dwarven Deeps, fleeing the terrible devastation of the Fey Reckoning. These fair folk brought tales of a wondrous world above filled with lush forests, sprawling plains, and glittering rivers. Dwarven curiosity was piqued.

#### Volkarr's Ascent
The heroic king Volkarr heeded the fey's stories and led an expedition to the surface world. What he and the dwarves discovered there astounded them - the open skies, warm sunlight, and verdant lands exceeded even their wildest dreams. Volkarr made a proclamation that the dwarves would establish a foothold on the surface, erecting the grand citadel of Heavenkeep atop Mount Elderspine as the capital of the Kingdom of Dorn.

#### Smith of Old and New
With the discovery of cerulium and the spread of the Arcane Revolution along the Aurum Trail, the dwarves proved themselves masters of the new magical technology. Already peerless crafters and smiths, they pioneered new arcane alloys and devices, and perfected mechanics and factories.

Their goods and expertise were soon spread across Erythea as cities like Azulihrun swelled with dwarven immigrants and traders. However, the dwarves never lost their deep cultural reverence for the bounties of the earth and their ancestral traditions.

#### The Umbral Legacy
Heavenkeep is merely the foremost of many dwarven holds, with roads stretching deep beneath the mountains linking to ancestral delvings like Mor Kadrin, Karakzi, and the fabled Umbralforge of Ignara. It is whispered that the dwarves still guard primordial secrets and relics from the First Age in these lightless labyrinths. 

#### First Age Heritage
As a First Age creation, Dwarves do not hold special relationship with one of the Great Spirits as they are not their creation. While they sometimes adopt the religion around Great Spirits that align with their calling, most Dwarves have the tradition of ancestral worship and praying to the spirits of the Mountains. 

Among the Great Spirits, the most common worship are Eridius–as the World Smith bless all that seek knowledge and perfection, Thanatris–for the Queen of the Underworld holds power of the cavern darkness and key to the ancestral sea, Seun the Scribe as well as Aresmun the Guardian are commonly worshipped as well.
