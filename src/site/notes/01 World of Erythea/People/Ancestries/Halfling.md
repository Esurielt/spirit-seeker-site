#### Origin
As creation of the Great Spirits Ninkasi the Brewer and Adonis the Shepherd, halflings are an upbeat, optimistic folk who find joy in life's simple pleasures—a hearty meal, a rousing tune, or a breathtaking view. Their natural wanderlust is seen as a spiritual calling, driving them to leave the comfort of their home and roam vast landscapes in search of tales untold, rare ingredients for their legendary brews, and experiences that will spark wonder in their retellings.

#### Idyll Communities of the Ebolon North
Halflings hail from the northern regions of Erythea, primarily Valcour and Caelinor. Traditional halfling communities dot the rural landscapes as small, tight-knit agricultural villages centered around breweries, cozy taverns, and roadside inns. While halflings toil as diligent agrarians through sowing and reaping seasons, they balance the labor during the rest of the year to celebrate almost any occasion with joyous, unbridled revelry. Halfling districts within cities are home to high-spirited festivities. Burrowsteads shelter generations under one roof while functioning as community centers – many a city-dweller has found solace in their comforting alehouses or relished treats from their famed culinary stands.

#### Spiritual Affinity
Possessing the most open-hearted compassion, halflings attune themselves easily to the spirits of the world. Generations pass down simple "stovetop" magics - songs, chants, and rituals woven into everyday brewing and cooking routines that invoke the strength of their family bound. Whether it's to invite blessings upon their brews or seek harmony with nature's rhythms, these gentle folk commune with local spirits effortlessly.

#### Tribulations of the Mana Waste
However, hardship has plagued the halfling communities as the expanding Mana Wastes laid waste to their farmlands. Many villages were forced into nomadic lifestyles; caravan families roamed alongside traveling brewers and musicians seeking temporary refuges. Some clans survived thanks to their innovative approach to animal husbandry, managing to maintain pastoral traditions even within the barren lands near the Wastes. 

Appearances are deceiving— within these nomadic tribes rose fierce halfling rangers and fighter.  Their tenacity belies their diminutive stature and stubborn nature, proving them invaluable scouts and travel guides across treacherous terrains.

The journey led many to Azulihrun; there they persist as itinerant bands or small enclaves seeking refuge from the war and wasteland. The unyielding spirit of halflings guarantees that you might encounter them on roads less traveled or offering solidarity within transient camps. Despite all the plight looming over their communities, halflings remain the most kindhearted yet relentlessly optimistic folk even in their darkest hours.
