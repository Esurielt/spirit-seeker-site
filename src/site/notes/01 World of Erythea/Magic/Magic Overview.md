# Magic
While magical effect weave through every aspect of the Erythean life, **Magic** or **sorcery** generally refer to spell craft that the caster channel through their own body, while **technology** often refers to [[01 World of Erythea/Magic/Arcanetech Overview\|Arcane Technology]] - artifacts and infrastructures that uses charged [[01 World of Erythea/Magic/Arcanetech Overview#Cerulite\|Cerulite]] as power source. Clockwork or mechanical technology refers to  technological applications that is developed independent of magic. The development of Clockwork technology set the foundation before the discovery of Arcane power stone, the Cerulite, which ushered the study of Arcane and its related technology to a new height. 

With the rise of Arcane technology and the new found peace after the collapse of the Gerian Empire, we see a decline of - and prejudice toward - the old magic. 

### Magical Traditions


### The Bloodstain History of Magic Restriction 
Magic has become highly restricted and sometimes downright forbidden in many countries - the following section delves into the reasons behind magic restrictions in Erythean history. 

#### Devastating Magical Warfare
There were a lot of devastating magical warfare during the Hundred Years of Conquest in the Age of Strife. Toward the end of the era, many country has signed treaties and imposed ban on powerful spellcraft in hope of constraining the ruination it has caused on land and countries. 
Particularly, the Gerian Empire, which used to rule much of the western Continents, executed their conquered countries' highest levels of mages in preservation of peace. The general distaste toward destructive magic has become a cultural norm on the western continent even after the Empire fractured and reclined. 
On the eastern continent however, magic education was already very restricted throughout its history. Academies, governments, and nobles houses guards their secrets and 

#### Magical power is reserved for the prophets of the Great Spirits 
Churches argue for their right over divine magic during the prosecution of mages; they endorse the execution of mages, and claims that magical power is reserved for the prophets of their Great Spirits. Through its grand conquest, Gerian Empire has established and converted the majority of the [[01 World of Erythea/Atlas/Eblon/Eblon\|Eblon]] to [[01 World of Erythea/Faith/Faith Overview#The Six Churches of Atlassia\|the Six Churches]], and prosecuted or exiled the other regional groups of worship (examples being the Elven worshipper of Shukar and Anshan followers of their ancestral spirits). While many religious group has evolved, or reclaimed their homeland and their faith after the Empire dissolved, the concept of guarding the divine magic and messengers behind closed doors has grown roots in people's mind due to religious distrust. 
Often time only a very selected amount of people that served as Oracles or Prophets of their religions are approved to wield magic in public. These Oracles often serve as the face of their religion. Smaller religious groups of minor deities have oracles, but it's often considered suspicious, and often get mixed up with witches (sometimes rightfully so).

#### Lasting Effect on Mages 
Many people, including scholars of magic believes that practicing magic - and sometime even studying the law of magic - could have an lasting effect on the magic user. Whether it is physical drain on the body, violent hallucinations and paranoia, social dysfunctional colored by a detachment from reality, or other negative symptoms that surface after long years of magic practice, many believes that magic channeling could taint one's essences or shatter their sanity. Even though there's some truth to this belief, others doubt the source of such negative effect being magical practice itself, as most of the famous mad mages were great warcasters in the Age of Strife, and the mages often face circumstances of extreme violence and power differences especially during the height of hundred years war. 

### Common Folks and Magic 
#### Magic Before the Strife 
Magic was not scarce in the old days. Anyone could learn and practice magic. There's no special bloodline even though some people might be more talented than others. Spiritmancy essentially is one's ability to listen and attune to the energy of the spirits on the fabric of their dream. 

Stovetop magic and ancestral worship is very common on every corner of Erythea; magical boons and threats also manifest in common folks everyday life - lighting your hearth with a prayer to your ancestral guardians, giving your loved ones a lucky wish through a kiss on their forehead... These magic are often unconscious ancestral magic that is not considered offensive or have an large scale effect. Divination, telekinesis, glamour, illusion, simple element manipulation, protection, and healing magic are among the particularly common kind of magic that even a non-mage might know a thing or two. 

However, mastery over magical art requires fine-toning through experience and studies. Before and during the age of Strife, hedge mages and court wizards alike are often both respected and feared, as they both wield expertise over their area of magical art and have the ability to cause common folks dangers - and many has through curses or war. In fact, to categorize them just as "mages" is an over generalization. They are considered a professional or sages for their specific areas and holds specific functions to the society, such as doctors, architects, war mages, diviners, carrier, artists, entertainers, and so on. 

#### The Fall of War Magic and the Rise of Arcane
Throughout history, most of the world's magical advancement before the Arcane Revolution has been focusing on its wartime application - warmages being the most common type of magic wielders, meaning majority of the magical knowledge on the grand scale of Erythea mages has been offensive. 

Toward the end of Age of Strife, fear toward magic rises and many countries tightened its policy on magical education, specifically restricted the use and knowledge of any magic that is considered offensive. Gone is the sorcery of eld, when powerful magicians leveled armies with impressive and potent manifestations, piloted caravels in the sky through sheer will alone, or summoned legions of spirits that flood cities with horror; these are now the province of fairy tales ever since these magic were lost forever in the massacre of mages and burning of aphotic tomes in Gerian Empire's path of conquest. Magic becomes a subject of research, religion, and social application that is more regulated by regional government.

Come is the age of Arcane when the Arcane school of mages (who focuses on the principle properties of magical manifestations and theories of its common behavior when interacting with the physical world) discovered the Cerulite, a "power stone" that could attune with a magic wielder and influence the fabric of magic for a short period of time. The discovery of this resources kicked off an technological revolution that would bring many benefits of magic in everyday household without the need of relying on individual's power. Magical artifacts were sold in stores to the general public and the rise of household appliances brought forth drastic growth in Atlassian economy and urban development.
