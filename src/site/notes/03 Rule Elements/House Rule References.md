## House Rule Mechanic References
### Rarity
Rarity in my games demonstrates the level of impact this element has on the story world. According to PF2 rulebooks, the rare and uncommon options are NOT stronger options, only more specific and complicated.  

<span class="pf-trait pf-trait-common"><a class = "internal-link" href = "/03-rule-elements/house-rule-references/#rarity-common">Common</a></span>  
You need no explanation using this option. People probably know of or are related to some one who have this. 
*(Any option that have no rarity trait labeled is Common)* { #rarity-common}


<span class="pf-trait pf-trait-uncommon"><a class = "internal-link" href = "/03-rule-elements/house-rule-references/#rarity-uncommon">Uncommon</a></span>  
This is the highest rarity you can choose normally. This option should be integrated into your character's backstory and be an notable part of your character. Local people only heard of tales of this option, and might be taken aback with woe and wonder because of it. { #rarity-uncommon}


<span class="pf-trait pf-trait-rare"><a class = "internal-link" href = "/03-rule-elements/house-rule-references/#rarity-rare">Rare</a></span> 
You may not choose this option unless you are rewarded with a rare option or you have discussed with me, because this option not only would have large impact on your character, but possibly the world if it is on a PC. It is still legal, and might be awarded as story goes on as well. It is an opportunity for us to write the setting of the story together and create the specific fantasy you are looking for. { #rarity-rare}


<span class="pf-trait pf-trait-limited"><a class = "internal-link" href = "/03-rule-elements/house-rule-references/#rarity-limited">Limited</a></span> 
This option is illegal—well, *mostly*—unless you convince me otherwise. You have 10 minutes—now go!{ #rarity-limited}


### Hero Points 
Hero points are more powerful on my table. When you use a hero point to reroll, your result equals to 10 + your proficiency modifier of the skill or your rolled result, whichever one is better. You also can reroll the damage of critical strikes. 

You can also use one hero point to create a flashback [similar to in "Blades in the Dark"](https://www.thelittlegnomeslibrary.com/flashback-system). I have the call on whether the flashback is valid, if it's invalid the flashback is not called. However, If you decide to not flashback after calling it, you still use the hero point. On your flashback roll:
>[!pf2rule] Flashback
>**Critical Success** Flashback happened as planned, and something amazing happens. 
>**Success** Flashback happened as planned, granting you the desired outcome of the Flashback. 
>**Failure** Flashback happened, it might increase awareness point or have other long-term implication depending on the flashback, but no immediate danger will come of it. 

I still aim to give out roughly 1 hero point per hour. Hero points carries over to the next session. 


### Currency
This campaign uses the RAW currency scaling of 1 pp = 10 gp = 100 sp = 1000 cp

Because of the increasing in trading in Eblon, there has been an increased standardization of currency policy. Each coin, regardless of the origin of mintage are often considered valid as long as the pureness and weight of the metal is consistent with the trade agreements, the coins would be considered acceptable. Stores often have machine with scales that could measure the weight of the coins of a certain kind. 

Currency in Pharousia are named the following:
CP: Copper pence
SP: Silver Shilling
GP: Gold Sovereign
PP: Platinum Crown

Money to USD reference: 
1 cp = $5
1 sp = $50
1 gp = $500
An unskilled labor makes 1 sp a day, roughly 2 gp a month. Current US minimum wage is about $1200 a month, for convenience, we will use $500/gp as the metric.
