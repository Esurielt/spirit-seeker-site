#### Mixed Heritage
>[!pf2rule] Custom Mixed Heritage 
> A custom mixed-ancestry heritage is an uncommon heritage. Choose an ancestry to tie to the heritage. You gain any traits of that ancestry and a new trait for your combined ancestry, similar to how the aiuvarin heritage below grants the “elf” and “aiuvarin” traits. You also gain low-light vision if the ancestry tied to the heritage has low-light vision or darkvision. The heritage lets you select ancestry feats for the chosen ancestry in addition to those from your base ancestry. The aiuvarin and dromaar heritages both have special feats, but a custom heritage will need you to work with your GM to create or adapt some.
