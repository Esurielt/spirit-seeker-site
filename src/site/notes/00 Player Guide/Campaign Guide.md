> In a world where magic flows from the dreams of ancient Spirits, you walk out of the bar to crowded streets and arcane-illuminated skies. The Age of Arcane has come, Magic cast not by attuning with the mystics of old, but by gleaming engines and clever artifice. Cerulium reactors now shape reality at the whims of an industrial few. Yet, walking down the lamp-lit avenues you sense a deeper malaise plaguing this progress. Whispers speak of unrest among the outcast mages, of strange disappearances and eerie events in the darkest alleys. You clutch your amulet beneath your cloak, a reminder of your own past encounters with forces unseen. Though the Sovereignty promises prosperity, you feel the currents of reality growing erratic, like the scattered raindrops before a storm. As the sun sets over the metropolis, you know tonight your vigilance and skill will be tested once more. Adventure calls.

## How to Use This Guide


Welcome to the spellpunk streets of Azulihrun, where arcane innovation lights up the night!

Cerulium trains roar through the city on trails of glimmering blue light. Enchanted airship drift over the chrome metropolis against the boundless sky. Mechanical marvels clatter down cobblestone lanes while flickering illusion ads dance across building facades. It’s the height of Arcane Revolution, when magical technology has reshaped every aspect of society. 

Yet behind the dazzling artifice, danger stirs in the shadow. Secret societies seek to rekindle old myth and avert rogue magic. Strange cults and radical groups seek forbidden knowledge or plot revolution to take back their power. Dangerous artifacts lie forgotten, waiting to be rediscovered. 

For whatever reason, you choose to walk the line between chaos and order, between myth and progress. As an agent of Seeker, You will unravel arcanities sinister and bizarre, confront abominations in darkness that mere light cannot pierce. But you possess more than mere light - the makings of legends.

### A New Dawn of Magic
Amid the majestic metropolis of Azulihrun, the empire’s testament to progress, whispers of the ancient myths dance just beyond the modern life. Many have never felt the benign call of the Great Spirits nor the intimate whispers of local spirits that wove magic into the very fabric of reality. Yet, these are not mere fables, but remnants of a heritage eclipsed by the dazzling Arcane Revolution.

A century ago, magic was an tradition practiced in every corner of Erythea, from humble village folk to majestic royalty—a power harnessed by communion with the Great Spirits and natural spirits alike, conjuring remarkable effects through an emotional attunement to reality's subtle whispers. We would speak in reverent tones of villagers who could hum ancient songs to coax flame to life on a frigid night, or recount tales of court mages divining fate of nations and protecting realms with their magical might. This communion with spirits was an intimate art—personal, often unpredictable, but deeply woven into the various cultures in Erythea.

The world has been transformed by Cerulium—a magical mineral discovered some eighty years ago, marking the dawn of the Arcane Revolution. Charged Cerulium stones can act as a conduit for consistent spellcasting. Today's arcane engineer does not coax or commune but instruct and command—weaving power inside ingeniously devised artifice through the reliable power stored within the cyan-hued crystals. It replaced the need of a constant dialogue with the spirits in spellcasting and turned it into factory pipelines and innovative machines. Now Arcane trains traverse vast territories, connecting cities and countries, while various gadgets proliferate daily life, executing harmless effect at a fingers' touch. Arcane academies preach a new dogma—one shorn of spirit-bound traditions and steeped in scientific principles and Cerulium techniques. 

Innovators herald this age as one of rationality and progress; detractors mourn it as an era where magic is stripped of its soul. The truth is, many among the city dwellers have grown detached from these ancient practices that shaped our history. The new generation, uprooted by a rush for new opportunities in the cities, have been schooled by industrious peddlers in virtues synonymous with advancement—convenience, speed, control. To question this narrative is to be brushed aside as nostalgic at best or be derided as superstitious at worst. Yet still, whispers persist—myths and fables passed down by elders where spirits strode alongside mortals—of magic that defies explanation by any Cerulium device.

Some churches dedicated to the Great Spirits issue dire warnings—proclaiming that unchecked Cerulium use spells doom for all. Secret societies operate in obscurity, preserving forbidden lore amidst chaotic times. And every so often, inexplicable phenomena challenge Arcane technology's promised dominion: rogue spells unleashing havoc, abominations prowl in shadowed alleys hinting at deeper unrest within reality itself.

For those versed only in Arcane teachings—a universe where magic is neatly parsed and catalogued—these occurrences are anomalies defying logic and the consequences of barbaric magic practices; for others who remember or dare believe in older truths, they are proof that not all can be contained or explained by Cerulium’s gleam. 


> [!pf2note|ttl-c] How "High Magic" is Erythea?
> It is important to note that Erythea, much like some of her spellpunk cousins, is more of a **wide** magic setting than a high magic one. 
> 
> While arcane artifacts that bring daily convenience is commonplace, people of this generation has largely forgotten the effect of spells weaved by powerful sorcerers. However, even among the traditional magic community, extremely powerful spells—such as long-distance, planar, and temporal travel, as well as true resurrection—remains beyond reach even for the most experienced mages and oracles. 
> 
> While village witches might know how to heal the sick, pray for rain, tell the fortune, they don't necessarily always get an definite response from the spirits. Legendary wizards of old epics who said to command weather and call forth disasters are incredibly rare, as it requires impeccable training and divine favor to commune with Great Spirits at a level that could result in such transformative magical effect.
> <p style="align-content:center;font-weight:700;margin-top:2em">What Does This Mean For Me?</p>
> 
> Mechanically, this means a few spells might not be legal or seen as incredibly Rare or Unique in this campaign. You can find out more information about magic options and their rarity in the chapter of [[00 Player Guide/Character Creation#Magic & Faith\|Creating Character: Magic & Faith]]. However, most spells are still available to PCs as you continue to discover the secrets of Spirit Magic. 
> 
> It also means that the high-rank spellcasting would be less likely to be available among the NPCs, since they were not taught as commonly to just any magic student. For example, in a level 14 settlement like Azulihrun, you would only find spellcasting services up to 4th-rank spells (as supposed to 7th-rank spells according to PF2 RAW).

### The Seekers of Pharousia

The Seekers is an ancient secret order devoted to protecting the realm from rogue magic and malevolent entities. For centuries, they have honed their skills in spellcraft and combat to meet each new supernatural threat in shadows. Though chapters span kingdoms and borders, their duty remains the same - to wield magic responsibly and solve mysteries beyond mortal ken.

Toward the start of the campaign, you and your party members arrived at the the Seekers' chapter quarters in Pharousia. The unique background options in Chapter [[01 Backgrounds\|Creating Character: Backgrounds]] present a handful of reason your PC might have been scouted, recruited, or invited as help. While you aren't required to choose one of these backgrounds, your character's backstory should involve some reason that the Seekers have reached out to you to join their ranks. 

In the revolutionized Pharousia, the Seekers stand at a crossroads. For centuries, they guarded the civilians against supernatural threats, but you come to the Seekers' Pharousia chapter in a time of change. 

A few decades ago, Seekers were branded outlaws along with many other traditional mages. After some targeted sweep, a series of tragedy with the recent surge of abominations, and continued derision toward the traditional magic, Seekers’ ranks in Azulihrun suffered greatly. But the tides have turned with the support of the new Sovereign; he even granted Seekers the official access and guardianship of the Reliquary Vault, a chamber full of confiscated artifacts. Of course, this gift comes with strings attached - oversight from the Crown, where their activities and the vault closely monitored.

As a new Seeker pledge, you will train under the fair and capable Chapter Master Viola Whytebourne. She has reluctantly accepted oversight from the Crown's representatives to secure the order's future. Together with new allies, you must navigate political tensions while investigating the rising mystical threats.

### Azulihrun at a Glance
The PCs begin this campaign in Azulihrun, one of the important location to the industrialization of Cerulium technologies in the Sovereignty of Pharousia, by the north-eastern coasts of Elbon. 
While the adventures might lead you outside of the city, the majority of the first arc would provide you with ample opportunity to explore the city that birthed Arcane Revolution. Whether your character is Azulihrun-born, a first- or second-generation immigrant, or a total newcomer, it's worthwhile to master some of the basic nomenclature in the Cerulean City. 

- [ ] #task Insert Erythea world map and Azulihrun region map.

This section will only cover important concept and terms that's connected to the start of the story. You can find more detailed information on the people and locations of the city in the location article of [[01 World of Erythea/Atlas/Eblon/Pharousia/Azulihrun\|Azulihrun, the Cerulean City]]. 

#### Azulihrun, the Cerulean Heart of Pharousia
While Azulihrun may not the capital of Pharousia, this vibrant metropolis is renowned as a beacon of culture and trade. Azulihrun sits in the bustling crossroads of the Aurum Trail -  a trade route stretching across various nations in Aerawan and Eblon. 

With the Arcane revolution, Azulihrun blossomed into an epicenter of innovation and progress. It played a pivotal role in propagating Arcane Technology along the Aurum Trail, contributing to advancements that have rippled across nations. Following a series of key Cerulium inventions, the Silverthorn Arcane Institute surpassed even the Royal Conservatory in Vashem, the Pharousian capital, as one of the most prominent arcane research center in the world. 

Notable Cerulium inventions from Azulihrun include Cerulium engines, levitating carriages, mechanical servants, and telescopic stargazing devices. The institute also holds significant authority over the study of Cerulium transportation like trains and airships.

Aside from its industrial prominence, Azulihrun has always been a melting pot of diverse cultures, and even more so since the revolution. Flooded with arcane scholars and workers seeking opportunities, the metropolis grows exponentially in the last five years to keep up with the immigrant from the surrounding region. The constant territorial conflicts between [[01 World of Erythea/Atlas/Eblon/04 Caelindor\|Caelindor]], [[01 World of Erythea/Atlas/Eblon/04 Valcour\|Valcour]] and its neighboring nations has always been a constant source of immigrants and refugees for Pharousia. Other than human immigrants of all sorts, we also see Goblins refugees from Izbudar, halfings and kobolds from Caelindor and Valcour, Dwarven crafters from Dorn, Shemtej Felidae and Lizardfolk traders from the Nebet deserts, Tengu and Sunkeeper Felidae from Aerawan. Many of them now came to Azulihrun seeking a new beginning. 

Positioned along the Jade Sea's coastline with the roaring Morrowind River bisecting it, Azulihrun is split into two halves: the historical side housing the lower and middle class called the Azul, and the wealthy side next to the noble keep known as Aulihrun. The river feeds water into factory machineries while allowing goods to be shipped efficiently. Its major exports are Cerulium technology, fish, and culture in the form of entertainment and art.

#### Skyspire Project
The Sovereign Emre Sarayli has recently initiated a national construction project called the Skyspires. This ambitious endeavor involves constructing a network of towers using the most advanced Cerulium technology. These towers will be capable of transmitting sensory magic, such as images and sound. Azulihrun has been chosen as the site for the first tower of its kind, with plans to erect more across the continent.

## Creating Character 
The city of Azulihrun has seen people from all walks of life. You are free to make any kind of character you like that could possibly live in Erythea, the following suggestion might help you get started and get the most out of this campaign. 

### Alignment, Edict, & Anathema
Pathfinder 2e Remaster has removed alignment as a concept and replaced with the more personal and nuanced character detail - Edict and Anathema. There's no restriction on character alignment. 

Since the story is focused on the Seekers and protecting the civilians from magical threats, it could be more immersive if your character share one or more of the Seekers' edicts and values, and you should keep in mind to avoid most, if not all, of the organization's anathemas. 

> [!pf2info] Seekers' Value, Edict, & Anathemas 
> **Edict** protect the civilians against supernatural threats, hunt and contain abominations and specters, investigate and study unexplained phenomenons.
> **Values** magical aptitude, decisive thinking, camaraderie, cooperation, containing danger, secrecy, pragmatism, dedication
**Anathemas** abandoning civilians in danger, cowardice, not improve one's magical and combat ability, let magical threat run wild, hurting the powerless

Character who does not care to improve the life of the citizens and protect the powerless can still take up their blade against the abominations. They could be chasing the thrill of combat, have a fascination for occult mystery, have a personal vendetta that happen to coincide with the Seekers, or simple needs money after your old practices were outlawed. 
More inspiration might be found in the [[00 Player Guide/Character Creation#Backgrounds\|Backgrounds]] section.

It was human industry that triggered the Arcane Revolution, with cities like Azulihrun now towering as wondrous cerulium-powered metropolises.

>[!pf2rule]- Dwarf - Ancient Builders from the Depth
> Ever since the First Age, dwarves–masters of stonecraft and metalwork–inhabited vast underground kingdoms in the subterranean world known as the Umbral Realm.

>Birthed from the dreams of Caelithra the Primordial Serpent and Eoluxe the Defying Trickster, goblins thrive in an anarchic meritocracy below the Elderspine Mountains. No hereditary rulers, only a ceaseless creative upheaval where cunning tinkers, daring arcanists, and skilled con-artists temporarily rise as "big bosses" through their innovative crafts and trickster exploits. Raucous marketplaces overflow with riotous tales spun by hobgoblin bards and intricate contraptions that is impossible to find a pair, as bargains, favors, and debts fuel a barter-based economy operating on sense of honor and responsibility.
>
> Goblin’s lingering distrust of "tall races" like humans stems from fresh injustices - enslaved for their cerulium mines, their lands razed by Valcour and Caelindor.

>
>In modern cities like Azulihrun, immigrants Felidae from the desert and forest alike serves as great fighters and explorers. Some are roaming traders or industrious small businesses living harmoniously among their long-time human neighbors.

>[!pf2rule]- Halfling - Joyful Shepherds of the Wasted North
>As creations of the Great Spirits Halora the Jubilant and Phaedras the Dawn Shepherd, halflings is an optimistic folk who find joy in life's simplest pleasure - a hearty feast, a rousing tale, an untrodden path. Their innate wanderlust drives them to roam distant vistas collecting exotic ingredients, experiences, and stories to enrich their legendary homebrews upon returning.
>
>Hailing from the northern realms of Valcour and Caelindor, traditional halfling communities thrived as idyllic agricultural villages surrounding breweries, inns, and cozy tavernsteads. Halflings possess a remarkable spiritual affinity, passing down humble "stovetop" magics woven into their brewing and cooking rituals to commune seamlessly with local nature spirits.
>
>However, the creep of the Mana Wastes caused by the magical warfares has decimated their homelands, uprooting halfling villages into nomadic diaspora or migrate into cities like Azulihrun. Within these nomadic tribes rose fierce halfling rangers and fighter. Despite all plights, halflings continue life's humble celebrations wherever their roads may roam.

Inheritors of draconic fire magics, their souls burn with Caelithra's blazing might.
>
>Many kobolds are also natural historians, with elders as living libraries safeguarding lore through oral traditions. Their culture treasures the excavation and preservation of history and relics from the first-age civilizations as a sacred duty. For some kobold tribes, central to their way of life are the mystic bonds kobolds forge with a beast companions at an young age through prehistoric rituals, each clan specializing in different animal kinships.
>
>With the Arcane Revolution's rise and Cerulium's proliferation, many kobold scholars seized the chance to travel far to unearth knowledge from bygone eras. Many was drawn to cultural capitals like Azulihrun, where their mastery over fire powered arcane forges and factories, scholars became archivists and researchers, and the beast-bonded kobolds roamed as rangers and handlers. Still favoring cavernous dwellings, kobolds transformed abandoned underground spaces into lush greenhouse communities - an intermingling of their ancestral ways with the urban life.

### Magic & Faith 
#### Magic
##### Impossible Magic
Erythea is a different from Golarion in many ways metaphysically–especially regarding planes of the world and the source of magic. Therefore, some magic that is related to the planes and the residence of each Golarion planes will need to be modified to fit the world of Erythea on a case by case basis. 
For example, Summon Celestial will summon different servant based on the deity that you pray to, if you wish to summon a specific creature when using the spell, you must clear with the GM before the session or when you prepare the spell. Summon Fey, on the other hand, can be easily explained as you ask for nearby spirits for help. 
Plane Shift and Resurrect are incredibly <span class="pf-trait pf-trait-rare"><a class = "internal-link" href = "/03-rule-elements/house-rule-references/#rarity-rare">Rare</a></span> in this world (since there's not many planes). Player and NPC would not normally have access to them. 

##### Illegal Magic 
Due to Pharousia's restriction on traditional and offensive magic, some magic might considered illegal to perform in the country, especially in the Azulihrun city. While Seekers does have the clearance to perform magic and not to be prosecuted, they would still need to do it in secret or they might still face arrest if there's police nearby. 
Casting any spell with an offensive ability is considered illegal and face charges up to life-time imprisonment or death; 
Manual magic without any involvement of certified Cerulium mechanism is illegal and could face fines and prison; 
Magic service without a Cerulium certification is also illegal and could face fines and prision.
