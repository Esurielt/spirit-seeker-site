> In a world where magic flows from the dreams of ancient Spirits, you walk out of the bar to crowded streets and arcane-illuminated skies. The Age of Arcane has come, Magic cast not by attuning with the mystics of old, but by gleaming engines and clever artifice. Cerulium reactors now shape reality at the whims of an industrial few. Yet, walking down the lamp-lit avenues you sense a deeper malaise plaguing this progress. Whispers speak of unrest among the outcast mages, of strange disappearances and eerie events in the darkest alleys. You clutch your amulet beneath your cloak, a reminder of your own past encounters with forces unseen. Though the Sovereignty promises prosperity, you feel the currents of magic growing erratic, like the scattered raindrops before a storm. As the sun sets over the metropolis, you know tonight your vigilance and skill will be tested once more. Adventure calls.

## How to Use This Guide


Welcome to the spellpunk streets of Azulihrun, where arcane innovation lights up the night!

Cerulium trains roar through the city on trails of glimmering blue light. Airships powered by enchanted engines drift over the chrome metropolis against the boundless sky. Mechanical marvels clatter down cobblestone lanes while flickering illusion ads dance across building facades. It’s the height of Arcane Revolution, when magical technology has reshaped every aspect of society. 

Yet behind the dazzling artifice, danger stirs in the shadow. Secret societies seek to rekindle old myth and avert rogue magic. Strange cults and radical groups seek forbidden knowledge or plot revolution to take back their power. Dangerous artifacts lie forgotten, waiting to be rediscovered. 

For whatever reason, you choose to walk the line between chaos and order, between myth and progress. As an agent of Seeker, You will unravel arcanities sinister and bizarre, confront abominations in darkness that mere light cannot pierce. But you possess more than mere light - the makings of legends. 

<div style=“text-align: center”><p>——</p></div>

## Coming Together

### A New Dawn of Magic

In the heart of the empire of Pharousia, a new dawn of magic shine over the city of Azulihrun. 

From time immemorial, Erytheans have harnessed magic by attuning themselves to the Great Spirits or the spirits around them, conjuring remarkable effects by sympathizing with the fabric of reality itself. From rural villages to noble courts, anyone—regardless of lineage or class—could learn to master the art of spirit communication and spellcasting. Ancestral worship and stovetop magic formed the cultural backbone of communities. Villagers would offer prayers to local spirits to keep their hearth aflame during winter nights or seek protection against malevolent entities from benign witches. In contrast, court mages served royalty by providing magical services in warfare and divination, while arcane academics dedicated their lives to devising innovative spells and magical tools to boost national power.

However, this delicate balance was shifted by an unprecedented event—the Arcane Revolution. In Pharousia, arcane scholars discovered Cerulium—a mineral capable of being temporarily charged to act as a conduit for magical energies. By substituting a living mage with charged Cerulium, this newfound technology facilitated magic's transition from an artform practiced by individual mages to a mass-produced commodity available to all. Cerulium-powered trains traverse vast territories, connecting cities and countries, while various gadgets proliferate daily life, executing harmless spells at a fingers' touch. 

While the advent of Cerulium brought about an era of unprecedented development, the structure of society warped under the strain of these changes. As magic became controlled by powerful figures who monopolized Cerulium-based industries, they enacted stringent restrictions on magic users and outlawed many spiritual magical practices. Traditional mages were forced to either join arcane factories as workers or face marginalization. Pushed toward the fringes of society, their timeless practices was frowned upon and misunderstood as backwards and barbaric. 

Meanwhile, many Churches of the Great Spirits preach doom if the use of Cerulium continues at its current rate. Some maintain a cold war with the government of Pharousia, claiming divine rights in wielding their spirit magic and foretell punishment by the gods; while others, such as Church of Ashur, collaborate to be recognize as a national religion and use it as an opportunity to weaken other churches and magic practitioners. 

Amidst this discordance grew organizations shadowed from public view—secret societies like the Seekers aiming to preserve magics and ensure peace amidst chaos; dark cults of mysterious entities drawing disillusioned souls into their malevolent embrace. 

The city streets already have enough to be worried about. A resurgence in abominations—entities born from corrupted spirits—and rogue mages seeking vengeance or power, stoke fears across the nation. The once rare disturbances became ominously commonplace, spurring whispers that some agency beyond mere human error was at play. 

> [!pf2note|ttl-c] How "High Magic" is Erythea?
> It is important to note that Erythea, much like some of her spellpunk cousins, is more of a **wide** magic setting than a high magic one. 
> 
> While magic that bring daily convenience is commonplace, extremely powerful spells—such as long-distance, planar, and temporal travel—are merely fairytales due to the intrinsic properties of magic and reality in Erythea. Similarly, while resurrection might be a familiar fantasy, it remains beyond reach even for the most experienced mages and oracles. 
> 
> While village witches might know how to heal the sick, pray for rain, tell the fortune, they don't necessarily always get an definite response. Legendary wizards of national epics who said to command weather and call forth disasters are incredibly rare, as it requires impeccable training and divine favor to commune with Great Spirits at a level that could result in such high-level magical effect.
> <p style="align-content:center;font-weight:700;margin-top:2em">What Does This Mean For Me?</p>
> 
> Mechanically, this means a few spells might not be legal or seen as incredibly Rare or Unique in this campaign. You can find out more information about magic options and their rarity in the chapter of [[00 Player Guide/Character Creation#Magic & Faith\|Creating Character: Magic & Faith]].
> 
> It also means that the high-rank spellcasting rarely would be available to NPCs. For example, in a level 14 settlement like Azulihrun, you would only find spellcasting services up to 4th-rank spells (as supposed to 7th-rank spells according to PF2 RAW).

### The Seekers of Pharousia

The Seekers is an ancient order devoted to protecting the realm from rogue magic and malevolent entities. For centuries, they have honed their skills in spellcraft and combat to meet each new supernatural threat. Though chapters span kingdoms and borders, their duty remains the same - to wield magic responsibly and solve mysteries beyond mortal ken.

Toward the start of the campaign, you and your party members arrived at the the Seekers' chapter quarters in Pharousia. The unique background options in Chapter [[01 Backgrounds\|Creating Character: Backgrounds]] present a handful of reason your PC might have been scouted, recruited, or invited as help. While you aren't required to choose one of these backgrounds, your character's backstory should involve some reason that the Seekers have reached out to you to join their ranks. 

In the revolutionized Pharousia, the Seekers stand at a crossroads. For centuries, they guarded the civilians against supernatural threats, but you come to the Seekers' Pharousia chapter in a time of change. 

A few years ago, Seekers were branded outlaws along with many other unofficial mages, in an effort to secure the means of magic by the Crown. After some targeted sweep and a series of tragedy in the recent surge of abominations, Seekers’ ranks in Azulihrun suffered severely. But the tides have turned with the support of the new Sovereign; he even granted Seekers the official access and guardianship of the Reliquary Vault, a chamber full of confiscated artifacts. Of course, this gift comes with strings attached - oversight from the Crown, where their activities and the vault closely monitored.

As a new Seeker pledge, you will train under the fair and capable Chapter Master Viola Whytebourne. She has reluctantly accepted oversight from the Crown's representatives to secure the order's future. Together with new allies, you must navigate political tensions while investigating the rising mystical threats.

### Azulihrun at a Glance
The PCs begin this campaign in Azulihrun, one of the important location to the industrialization of Cerulium technologies in the Sovereignty of Pharousia, by the north-eastern coasts of Elbon. 
While the adventures might lead you outside of the city, the majority of the first arc would provide you with ample opportunity to explore the city that birthed Arcane Revolution. Whether your character is Azulihrun-born, a first- or second-generation immigrant, or a total newcomer, it's worthwhile to master some of the basic nomenclature in the Cerulean City. 

- [ ] #task Insert Erythea world map and Azulihrun region map.

This section will only cover important concept and terms that's connected to the start of the story. You can find more detailed information on the people and locations of the city in the location article of [[01 World of Erythea/Atlas/Ebolon/Pharousia/Azulihrun\|Azulihrun, the Cerulean City]]. 

#### Azulihrun in Pharousia
While Azulihrun is not the capital of Pharousia, it has always been the country's crown jewel of culture and trade. Azulihrun sits in the in the center of the Aurum Trail -  a bustling trade route stretching across various nations in Aerawan and Ebolon,  from Kadiya and Xia-Zhou, to Pharousia, Dorn, Nephara, and Qahalim. 

Now with the Arcane revolution, the city has also become a industrial center of progress and innovation, and contributed greatly to the spread of Arcane Technology along the Aurum Trail. Following the various important Cerulium inventions, Silverthorn Arcane Institute of Azulihrun has since become one of the most prominent arcane academies in the world, surpassing even the Royal Conservatory in Vashem, the Capital of Pharousia. 

To name a few inventions that was conceived in the Cerulean City - Cerulium carriage that levitates in the air with magical wheels, mechanical servants and companions that follows simple command, arcane telescope that sees far into the horizon and can track the trail of stars. Silverthorn also has the most authority on Cerulium transportation - such as trains and airship. 

Other than being the center of Cerulium industry, Azulihrun is also the most cosmopolitan city in Pharousia, and even more so since the revolution. Flooded with arcane scholars and workers seeking opportunities, the metropolis grows exponentially in the last five years to keep up with the immigrant from the surrounding region. The constant territorial conflicts between [[01 World of Erythea/Atlas/Ebolon/Caelindor\|Caelindor]], [[01 World of Erythea/Atlas/Ebolon/Valcour\|Valcour]] and its neighboring nations has always been a constant source of immigrants and refugees for Pharousia, and many of them now came to Azulihrun seeking a new life. 

Azulihrun sits along the coast of Jade Sea and is divided by the roaring Morrowind River into the lower-middle class side of the city known as the Azul and the noble and wealthy side of Aulihrun. The river feeds water into factory machineries while allowing goods to be shipped efficiently. Its major exports are Cerulium technology, fish, and culture in the form of entertainment and art.

#### Skyspire
The Sovereign Emre Sarayli has recently initiated a national construction project called the Skyspires, a network of artificial towers built with the most advanced Cerulium technology. These towers will be capable of transmitting sensory magic, such as images and sound. 

Azulihrun will be the site of the first tower of its kind, while subsequent towers are planned to be constructed across the continent.

## Creating Character 
The city of Azulihrun has seen people from all walks of life. You are free to make any kind of character you like that could possibly live in Erythea, the following suggestion might help you get started and get the most out of this campaign. 

- [ ] #task List of Great Spirits, just fucking do it
- [ ] #task Magic overview 

### Alignment, Edict, & Anathema
Pathfinder 2e Remaster has removed alignment as a concept and replaced with the more personal and nuanced character detail - Edict and Anathema. There's no restriction on character alignment. 

Since the story is focused on the Seekers and protecting the civilians from magical threats, it could be more immersive if your character share one or more of the Seekers' edicts and values, and you should keep in mind to avoid most, if not all, of the organization's anathemas. 

> [!pf2info] Seekers' Value, Edict, & Anathemas 
> **Edict** protect the civilians against supernatural threats, hunt and contain abominations and specters, investigate and study unexplained phenomenons.
> **Values** magical aptitude, decisive thinking, camaraderie, cooperation, containing danger, secrecy, pragmatism, dedication
**Anathemas** abandoning civilians in danger, cowardice, not improve one's magical and combat ability, let magical threat run wild, hurting the powerless

Character who does not care to improve the life of the citizens and protect the powerless can still take up their blade against the abominations. They could be chasing the thrill of combat, have a fascination for occult mystery, have a personal vendetta that happen to coincide with the Seekers, or simple needs money after your old practices were outlawed. 
More inspiration might be found in the [[00 Player Guide/Campaign Guide#Backgrounds\|#Backgrounds]] section. 

### Ancestries
Erythea is a diverse world teeming with fascinating culture and ancestries. Collectively, the humanoid mortal inhabitants of the world are commonly referred to as the mankind. The [[01 World of Erythea/People/Ancestries\|Ancestries]] page has more detail about each Ancestries entries. The following are the ancestries and lineages you could find in the world of Erythea. 

>[!pf2rule] TLDR 
> Among the common ancestries, these following are [[03 Rule Elements/House Rule References#^rarity-rare\|Rare]]: Elf, Gnome, Leshy. Meaning, you cannot choose these ancestries without a rare option reward / discussion with GM. The lore of these ancestries could be found in the [[01 World of Erythea/People/Ancestries\|Ancestries]] page. 
> 
> Please refer to the list for availability on all other published ancestries. Note that [[03 Rule Elements/House Rule References#^rarity-uncommon\|Uncommon]] ancestries needs to be strongly incorporated into your character story, as they would invite development in the campaign. 


Common 
>[!pf2rule]- Human - Driven Settlers of the World
>Of all the mortal races, none are more numerous and driven than humans. Blessed with ambitious versatility yet cursed by fleeting lifespans, they chase their passions with fervent urgency. This volatile spirit allows humans to attune deeply with the impassioned essences of magic and spirits.
>
>Humans revere Ashur, the Great Spirit of Cities and Law, as patron of their monumental civilizations like Pharousia, Caelindor, Valcour, and Qahilim. It was human industry that triggered the Arcane Revolution, with cities like Azulihrun now towering as wondrous cerulium-powered metropolises.

>[!pf2rule]- Dwarf - Ancient Builders from the Depth
> Ever since the First Age, dwarves–masters of stonecraft and metalwork–inhabited vast underground kingdoms in the subterranean world known as the Umbral Realm. Then the wandering fey refugees, fleeing the terrible devastation of the Fey Reckoning, brought tales of the wondrous surface realms. Inspired, King Volkarr led the an expedition and established the Kingdom of Dorn, constructing the grand citadel of Heavenkeep on Mount Elderspine as their first surface holding.
> 
> With the Arcane Revolution and discovery of cerulium, dwarven artifice achieved new heights. Their innovative arcane alloys, mechanizations and expertly crafted goods spread across Erythea, including to cities like Azulihrun where many dwarves has immigrated. However, dwarves never lost reverence for their ancestral dwelings in the Umbral Realm like Mor Kadin and the fabled Umbralforge of Ignara. 

>[!pf2rule]- Goblin / Hobgoblins - Ingenious Anarchists of the Elderspine
>Birthed from the primordial dreams of Tiamat and Panzuzu, goblins thrive in an anarchic meritocracy within the Elderspine Mountains. No hereditary rulers, only a ceaseless creative upheaval where cunning tinkers, daring arcanists, and skilled con-artists temporarily rise as "big bosses" through their innovative crafts and trickster exploits. Raucous marketplaces overflow with intricate contraptions as barters, favors, and debts fuel an ad hoc economy alongside riotous tales spun by hobgoblin bards.
>
> A lingering distrust of "tall races" like humans stems from past injustices - enslaved for their cerulium mines, their lands razed by Valcour and Caelindor. Only through dwarven allies could the goblin persevere their culture, though many remain refugees at the fringes of foreign cities, seeking to rebuild their meritocratic traditions and vibrant culture of chaotic ingenuity.

>[!pf2rule]- Felidae - Feline Hunters of Deserts and Forests
>Catfolks, or Felidae, renowned for their grace, sociability, and inquisitiveness, were created by Ninurta the Ranger and Ninkasi the Brewer in the Second Age. Imbued with feline grace, curiosity, and wanderlust, the catfolk quickly spread across savannas and woodlands.
>
>In the harsh deserts of Nebet, the nomadic Nephara civilization arose, with Felidae tribes banding together with lizardfolk and other beast-kin. Nepharan warriors became renowned for their litheness and fearlessness in battle.
>
>Not all Felidae remained nomadic, however. Many adapted as hunters and rangers in the forests of Ebolon and Aerawan, offering skills to other civilizations. In the wild, they shelter in hidden aeries, wandering the ancient Secret Paths only they know.
>
>In modern cities like Azulihrun, Felidae have integrated well thanks to their inherent cultural curiosity and charm. Yet many long for a return to feral roots, either joining cat-cults or seeking ancient Nepharan elemental powers to reclaim their primal spiritual connection.
