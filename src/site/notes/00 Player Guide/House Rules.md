## Table Etiquettes
By playing at the table, we should be bounded by the following social contract. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the etiquettes of play, please reach out at any time! 

### Guidelines of Play 
##### Common Courtesy and Respect
this should go without saying, be mindful, respectful, and inquisitive. 

##### Safewords and Boundray
If anything or anyone makes you uncomfortable, including the GM, invoke the magic word of "Banana Juice" in a private message or the public chat. People should simply move on from current topic without the needs of explanation and curiosity. Please don't use this key phrase for other reasons. 
If there's any particular topics of sensitivity, please immediately inform the GM!

### Intent of Play
The following are the intended experience of the table! When encountering creative differences and frustration, we can use these as the foundation to build our play.  
##### To Seek a Particular Fantasy
The name of the game is fantasy. We will work together to make sure the core of your fantasy can be reflected and achieved in the game! We will shape the world around the experiences that you want to play.  
##### To Create Unforgettable Epic Tales 
While I have created much of the setting, the story of the game is ours - and mainly yours - to weave. Throughout the game, we will encourage spotlights on your character as well as how they interconnect with each other in the trying journey of world-saving and bad-guys smashing. 
##### NOT To Exploit 
The logic of the world and the system is not impeccable, nor is my intention to make them so. I'm sure we will find a gadget that conceptionally might break the world, or a spell combo that is too good for its level. I ask us, in service of the story, to accept the suspension of disbelief and simply discuss the technicalities as jokes and ideas that might inspire other fantasy. 
##### NOT to Ruin Others Fun 
Whether it is a topic dragged to long or a joke that makes someone uncomfortable, we sometimes come up with ideas in the creative journey that might cost other's. 
The point of the game is to roleplay interesting narratives. I ask us to practice patience and respect when it comes to others' time to shine - and not, through jests and ruse, discourage others from roleplay and creativity. Use the safewords in situation where you starts to feel unfun, and everyone should respect it.  
This also means **No Joke Character** - the character can have a fun goal or fixation, but no Farty McFurryballs or Firehand the Fireballmancer. We can always play these characters in one-shots or short adventures.

## Fun Mechanic References
### Rarity
Rarity in my games demonstrates the level of impact this element has on the story world. According to PF2 rulebooks, the rare and uncommon options are NOT stronger options, only more specific and complicated.  

<span class="pf-trait pf-trait-common"><a class = "pf-trait-common" href = "/03-Rule-Elements/House-Rule-References/#rarity-common">Common</a></span>  
You need no explanation using this option. People probably know of or are related to some one who have this. 
*(Any option that have no rarity trait labeled is Common)* 
^rarity-common

<span class="pf-trait pf-trait-uncommon">Uncommon</span>  
This is the highest rarity you can choose normally. This option should be integrated into your character's backstory and be an notable part of your character. Local people only heard of tales of this option, and might be taken aback with woe and wonder because of it. 
^rarity-uncommon

<span class="pf-trait pf-trait-rare">Rare</span> 
You may not choose this option unless you are rewarded with a rare option or you have discussed with me, because this option not only would have large impact on your character, but possibly the world if it is on a PC. It is still legal, and might be awarded as story goes on as well. It is an opportunity for us to write the setting of the story together and create the specific fantasy you are looking for. 
^rarity-rare

<span class="pf-trait pf-trait-limited">Limited</span> 
This option is illegal—well, *mostly*—unless you convince me otherwise. You have 10 minutes—now go!
^rarity-limited

### Currency
This campaign uses the RAW currency scaling of 1 pp = 10 gp = 100 sp = 1000 cp

Because of the increasing in trading in Eblon, there has been an increased standardization of currency policy. Each coin, regardless of the origin of mintage are often considered valid as long as the pureness and weight of the metal is consistent with the trade agreements, the coins would be considered acceptable. Stores often have machine with scales that could measure the weight of the coins of a certain kind. 

Currency in Pharousia are named the following:
CP: Copper pence
SP: Silver Shilling
GP: Gold Sovereign
PP: Platinum Crown

Money to USD reference: 
1 cp = $5
1 sp = $50
1 gp = $500
An unskilled labor makes 1 sp a day, roughly 2 gp a month. Current US minimum wage is about $1200 a month, for convenience, we will use $500/gp as the metric.
