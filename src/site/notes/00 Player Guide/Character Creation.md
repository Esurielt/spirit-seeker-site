The city of Azulihrun has seen people from all walks of life. You are free to make any kind of character you like that could possibly live in Erythea, the following suggestion might help you get started and get the most out of this campaign. 

- [ ] #task List of Great Spirits, just fucking do it
- [ ] #task Magic overview 

### Alignment, Edict, & Anathema
Pathfinder 2e Remaster has removed alignment as a concept and replaced with the more personal and nuanced character detail - Edict and Anathema. There's no restriction on character alignment. 

Since the story is focused on the Seekers and protecting the civilians from magical threats, it could be more immersive if your character share one or more of the Seekers' edicts and values, and you should keep in mind to avoid most, if not all, of the organization's anathemas. 

> [!pf2info] Seekers' Value, Edict, & Anathemas 
> **Edict** protect the civilians against supernatural threats, hunt and contain abominations and specters, investigate and study unexplained phenomenons.
> **Values** magical aptitude, decisive thinking, camaraderie, cooperation, containing danger, secrecy, pragmatism, dedication
**Anathemas** abandoning civilians in danger, cowardice, not improve one's magical and combat ability, let magical threat run wild, hurting the powerless

Character who does not care to improve the life of the citizens and protect the powerless can still take up their blade against the abominations. They could be chasing the thrill of combat, have a fascination for occult mystery, have a personal vendetta that happen to coincide with the Seekers, or simple needs money after your old practices were outlawed. 
More inspiration might be found in the [[00 Player Guide/Character Creation#Backgrounds\|#Backgrounds]] section.

#### Common

>[!pf2rule]- Human - Driven Settlers of the World
>Of all the mortal races, none are more numerous and driven than humans. Blessed with ambitious versatility yet cursed by fleeting lifespans, they chase their passions with fervent urgency. This volatile spirit allows humans to attune deeply with the impassioned essences of magic and spirits.
>
>Humans revere Ashur, the Great Spirit of Cities and Law, as patron of their monumental civilizations like Pharousia, Caelindor, Valcour, and Qahilim. It was human industry that triggered the Arcane Revolution, with cities like Azulihrun now towering as wondrous cerulium-powered metropolises.

>[!pf2rule]- Dwarf - Ancient Builders from the Depth
> Ever since the First Age, dwarves–masters of stonecraft and metalwork–inhabited vast underground kingdoms in the subterranean world known as the Umbral Realm. Then the wandering fey refugees, fleeing the terrible devastation of the Fey Reckoning, brought tales of the wondrous surface realms. Inspired, King Volkarr led the an expedition and established the Kingdom of Dorn, constructing the grand citadel of Heavenkeep on Mount Elderspine as their first surface holding.
> 
> With the Arcane Revolution and discovery of cerulium, dwarven artifice achieved new heights. Their innovative arcane alloys, mechanizations and expertly crafted goods spread across Erythea, including to cities like Azulihrun where many dwarves has immigrated. However, dwarves never lost reverence for their ancestral dwelings in the Umbral Realm like Mor Kadin and the fabled Umbralforge of Ignara. 

>[!pf2rule]- Goblin / Hobgoblins - Ingenious Anarchists of the Elderspine
>Birthed from the primordial dreams of Tiamat and Panzuzu, goblins thrive in an anarchic meritocracy within the Elderspine Mountains. No hereditary rulers, only a ceaseless creative upheaval where cunning tinkers, daring arcanists, and skilled con-artists temporarily rise as "big bosses" through their innovative crafts and trickster exploits. Raucous marketplaces overflow with intricate contraptions as barters, favors, and debts fuel an ad hoc economy alongside riotous tales spun by hobgoblin bards.
>
> A lingering distrust of "tall races" like humans stems from past injustices - enslaved for their cerulium mines, their lands razed by Valcour and Caelindor. Only through dwarven allies could the goblin persevere their culture, though many remain refugees at the fringes of foreign cities, seeking to rebuild their meritocratic traditions and vibrant culture of chaotic ingenuity.

>[!pf2rule]- Felidae - Feline Hunters of Deserts and Forests
>Catfolks, or Felidae, renowned for their grace, sociability, and inquisitiveness, were created by Ninurta the Ranger and Ninkasi the Brewer in the Second Age. Imbued with feline grace, curiosity, and wanderlust, the catfolk quickly spread across savannas and woodlands.
>
>In the harsh deserts of Nebet, the nomadic Nephara civilization arose, with Felidae tribes banding together with lizardfolk and other beast-kin. Nepharan warriors became renowned for their litheness and fearlessness in battle.
>
>Not all Felidae remained nomadic, however. Many adapted as hunters and rangers in the forests of Ebolon and Aerawan, offering skills to other civilizations. In the wild, they shelter in hidden aeries, wandering the ancient Secret Paths only they know.
>
>In modern cities like Azulihrun, Felidae have integrated well thanks to their inherent cultural curiosity and charm. Yet many long for a return to feral roots, either joining cat-cults or seeking ancient Nepharan elemental powers to reclaim their primal spiritual connection.

>[!pf2rule]- Halfling - Joyful Shepherds of the Wasted North
>As creations of the Great Spirits Ninkasi the Brewer and Adonis the Shepherd, halflings is an optimistic folk who find joy in life's simplest pleasure - a hearty feast, a rousing tale, an untrodden path. Their innate wanderlust drives them to roam distant vistas collecting exotic ingredients, experiences, and stories to enrich their legendary homebrews upon returning.
>
>Hailing from the northern realms of Valcour and Caelindor, traditional halfling communities thrived as idyllic agricultural villages surrounding breweries, inns, and cozy tavernsteads. Halflings possess a remarkable spiritual affinity, passing down humble "stovetop" magics woven into their brewing and cooking rituals to commune seamlessly with local nature spirits.
>
>However, the creep of the Mana Wastes caused by the magical warfares has decimated their homelands, uprooting halfling villages into nomadic diaspora or migrate into cities like Azulihrun. Within these nomadic tribes rose fierce halfling rangers and fighter. Despite all plights, halflings continue life's humble celebrations wherever their roads may roam.

>[!pf2rule]- Kobold - Dragonkin Archivists of the Lush Caverns
>Forged by Tiamat and Isimud from the sorrow of the lost dragon lineage, kobolds are the cunning, proud dragonkin native to Erythea's Northern mountains and isles. More than mere delvers, they are masterful underground gardeners cultivating rare fungi and bioluminescent flora in magnificent subterranean realms. Inheritors of draconic fire magics, their souls burn with Tiamat's blazing might.
>
>Yet kobolds are also historians without peer, with venerable elders as living libraries safeguarding primordial lore through intricate oral traditions. Their culture enshrines the excavation and preservation of relics from ancient civilizations as a sacred duty. Central to their way of life are the mystic bonds kobolds forge with beast companions from a young age through prehistoric rituals, each clan specializing in different animal kinships.
>
>With the Arcane Revolution's rise and Cerulium's proliferation, many kobold scholars seized the chance to travel far to unearth knowledge from bygone eras. Many was drawn to cultural capitals like Azulihrun, where their mastery over fire powered arcane forges and factories, scholars became archivists and researchers, and the beast-bonded kin roamed as rangers and handlers. Favoring cavernous dwellings, kobolds transformed abandoned underground spaces into lush greenhouse communities - an intermingling of their ancestral ways with the urban life.
