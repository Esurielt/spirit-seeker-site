## Creating Character 
The city of Azulihrun has seen people from all walks of life. You are free to make any kind of character you like that could possibly live in Erythea, the following suggestion might help you get started and get the most out of this campaign. 

### Alignment, Edict, & Anathema
Pathfinder 2e Remaster has removed alignment as a concept and replaced with the more personal and nuanced character detail - Edict and Anathema. There's no restriction on character alignment. 

Since the story is focused on the Seekers and protecting the civilians from magical threats, it could be more immersive if your character share one or more of the Seekers' edicts and values, and you should keep in mind to avoid most, if not all, of the organization's anathemas. 

> [!pf2info] Seekers' Value, Edict, & Anathemas 
> **Edict** protect the civilians against supernatural threats, hunt and contain abominations and specters, investigate and study unexplained phenomenons.
> **Values** magical aptitude, decisive thinking, camaraderie, cooperation, containing danger, secrecy, pragmatism, dedication
**Anathemas** abandoning civilians in danger, cowardice, not improve one's magical and combat ability, let magical threat run wild, hurting the powerless

Character who does not care to improve the life of the citizens and protect the powerless can still take up their blade against the abominations. They could be chasing the thrill of combat, have a fascination for occult mystery, have a personal vendetta that happen to coincide with the Seekers, or simple needs money after your old practices were outlawed. 
More inspiration might be found in the [[00 Player Guide/Character Creation#Backgrounds\|Backgrounds]] section.

>
>Humans revere Zefaelon, the Great Spirit of Cities and Law, as patron of their monumental civilizations like Pharousia, Caelindor, Valcour, and Qahilim.

It was human industry that triggered the Arcane Revolution, with cities like Azulihrun now towering as wondrous cerulium-powered metropolises.

>[!pf2rule]- Dwarf - Ancient Builders from the Depth
> Ever since the First Age, dwarves–masters of stonecraft and metalwork–inhabited vast underground kingdoms in the subterranean world known as the Umbral Realm. Then the wandering fey refugees, fleeing the terrible devastation of the Fey Reckoning, brought tales of the wondrous surface realms.

> 
> With the Arcane Revolution and discovery of cerulium, dwarven artifice achieved new heights. Their innovative arcane alloys, mechanizations and expertly crafted goods spread across Erythea, including to cities like Azulihrun where many dwarves has immigrated.

>[!pf2rule]- Goblin / Hobgoblins - Ingenious Anarchists of the Elderspine
>Birthed from the dreams of Caelithra the Primordial Serpent and Eoluxe the Defying Trickster, goblins thrive in an anarchic meritocracy below the Elderspine Mountains. No hereditary rulers, only a ceaseless creative upheaval where cunning tinkers, daring arcanists, and skilled con-artists temporarily rise as "big bosses" through their innovative crafts and trickster exploits. Raucous marketplaces overflow with riotous tales spun by hobgoblin bards and intricate contraptions that is impossible to find a pair, as bargains, favors, and debts fuel a barter-based economy operating on sense of honor and responsibility.
>
> Goblin’s lingering distrust of "tall races" like humans stems from fresh injustices - enslaved for their cerulium mines, their lands razed by Valcour and Caelindor.

>
>In modern cities like Azulihrun, immigrants Felidae from the desert and forest alike serves as great fighters and explorers. Some are roaming traders or industrious small businesses living harmoniously among their long-time human neighbors.

>[!pf2rule]- Halfling - Joyful Shepherds of the Wasted North
>As creations of the Great Spirits Halora the Jubilant and Phaedras the Dawn Shepherd, halflings is an optimistic folk who find joy in life's simplest pleasure - a hearty feast, a rousing tale, an untrodden path. Their innate wanderlust drives them to roam distant vistas collecting exotic ingredients, experiences, and stories to enrich their legendary homebrews upon returning.
>
>Hailing from the northern realms of Valcour and Caelindor, traditional halfling communities thrived as idyllic agricultural villages surrounding breweries, inns, and cozy tavernsteads. Halflings possess a remarkable spiritual affinity, passing down humble "stovetop" magics woven into their brewing and cooking rituals to commune seamlessly with local nature spirits.
>
>However, the creep of the Mana Wastes caused by the magical warfares has decimated their homelands, uprooting halfling villages into nomadic diaspora or migrate into cities like Azulihrun. Within these nomadic tribes rose fierce halfling rangers and fighter. Despite all plights, halflings continue life's humble celebrations wherever their roads may roam.

Inheritors of draconic fire magics, their souls burn with Caelithra's blazing might.
>
>Many kobolds are also natural historians, with elders as living libraries safeguarding lore through oral traditions. Their culture treasures the excavation and preservation of history and relics from the first-age civilizations as a sacred duty. For some kobold tribes, central to their way of life are the mystic bonds kobolds forge with a beast companions at an young age through prehistoric rituals, each clan specializing in different animal kinships.
>
>With the Arcane Revolution's rise and Cerulium's proliferation, many kobold scholars seized the chance to travel far to unearth knowledge from bygone eras. Many was drawn to cultural capitals like Azulihrun, where their mastery over fire powered arcane forges and factories, scholars became archivists and researchers, and the beast-bonded kobolds roamed as rangers and handlers. Still favoring cavernous dwellings, kobolds transformed abandoned underground spaces into lush greenhouse communities - an intermingling of their ancestral ways with the urban life.

### Magic & Faith 
#### Magic
##### Impossible Magic
Erythea is a different from Golarion in many ways metaphysically–especially regarding planes of the world and the source of magic. Therefore, some magic that is related to the planes and the residence of each Golarion planes will need to be modified to fit the world of Erythea on a case by case basis. 
For example, Summon Celestial will summon different servant based on the deity that you pray to, if you wish to summon a specific creature when using the spell, you must clear with the GM before the session or when you prepare the spell. Summon Fey, on the other hand, can be easily explained as you ask for nearby spirits for help. 
Plane Shift and Resurrect are incredibly <span class="pf-trait pf-trait-rare"><a class = "internal-link" href = "/03-rule-elements/house-rule-references/#rarity-rare">Rare</a></span> in this world (since there's not many planes). Player and NPC would not normally have access to them. 

##### Illegal Magic 
Due to Pharousia's restriction on traditional and offensive magic, some magic might considered illegal to perform in the country, especially in the Azulihrun city. While Seekers does have the clearance to perform magic and not to be prosecuted, they would still need to do it in secret or they might still face arrest if there's police nearby. 
Casting any spell with an offensive ability is considered illegal and face charges up to life-time imprisonment or death; 
Manual magic without any involvement of certified Cerulium mechanism is illegal and could face fines and prison; 
Magic service without a Cerulium certification is also illegal and could face fines and prision.

\*\*\* All these lores can be more specific. E.g., one can choose to be trained in World Nobility lore, Pharousian Nobility Lore, or only Azulihrun nobility lore.
