## Creating Character 
The city of Azulihrun has seen people from all walks of life. You are free to make any kind of character you like that could possibly live in Erythea, the following suggestion might help you get started and get the most out of this campaign. 

- [ ] #task List of Great Spirits, just fucking do it
- [ ] #task Magic overview 

### Alignment, Edict, & Anathema
Pathfinder 2e Remaster has removed alignment as a concept and replaced with the more personal and nuanced character detail - Edict and Anathema. There's no restriction on character alignment. 

Since the story is focused on the Seekers and protecting the civilians from magical threats, it could be more immersive if your character share one or more of the Seekers' edicts and values, and you should keep in mind to avoid most, if not all, of the organization's anathemas. 

> [!pf2info] Seekers' Value, Edict, & Anathemas 
> **Edict** protect the civilians against supernatural threats, hunt and contain abominations and specters, investigate and study unexplained phenomenons.
> **Values** magical aptitude, decisive thinking, camaraderie, cooperation, containing danger, secrecy, pragmatism, dedication
**Anathemas** abandoning civilians in danger, cowardice, not improve one's magical and combat ability, let magical threat run wild, hurting the powerless

Character who does not care to improve the life of the citizens and protect the powerless can still take up their blade against the abominations. They could be chasing the thrill of combat, have a fascination for occult mystery, have a personal vendetta that happen to coincide with the Seekers, or simple needs money after your old practices were outlawed. 
More inspiration might be found in the [[00 Player Guide/Character Creation#Backgrounds\|Backgrounds]] section.

Halflings possess a remarkable spiritual affinity, passing down humble "stovetop" magics woven into their brewing and cooking rituals to commune seamlessly with local nature spirits.
>
>However, the creep of the Mana Wastes caused by the magical warfares has decimated their homelands, uprooting halfling villages into nomadic diaspora or migrate into cities like Azulihrun.

For some kobold tribes, central to their way of life are the mystic bonds kobolds forge with a beast companions at an young age through prehistoric rituals, each clan specializing in different animal kinships.
>
