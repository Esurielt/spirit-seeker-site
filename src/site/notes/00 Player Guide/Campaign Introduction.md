## Coming Together

### A New Dawn of Magic

In the heart of the empire of Pharousia, a new dawn of magic shine over the city of Ambrose. 

From time immemorial, Erytheans have harnessed magic by attuning themselves to the Great Spirits or the spirits around them, conjuring remarkable effects by causing ripples in the fabric of reality itself. From rural villages to noble courts, anyone—regardless of lineage or class—could learn to master the art of spirit communication and spellcasting. Ancestral worship and stovetop magic formed the cultural backbone of communities. Villagers would offer prayers to local spirits to keep their hearth aflame during winter nights or seek protection against malevolent entities from benign witches. In contrast, court mages served royalty by providing magical services in warfare and divination, while arcane academics dedicated their lives to devising innovative spells and magical tools to boost national power.

However, this delicate balance was shifted by an unprecedented event—the Arcane Revolution. In Pharousia, arcane scholars discovered Cerulium—a mineral capable of being temporarily charged to act as a conduit for magical energies. By substituting a living mage with charged Cerulium, this newfound technology facilitated magic's transition from an artform practiced by individual mages to a mass-produced commodity available to all. Cerulium-powered trains traverse vast territories, connecting cities and countries, while various gadgets proliferate daily life, executing harmless spells at a fingers' touch. 

While the advent of Cerulium brought about an era of unprecedented development, the structure of society warped under the strain of these changes. As magic became controlled by powerful figures who monopolized Cerulium-based industries, they enacted stringent restrictions on magic users and outlawed many spiritual magical practices. Traditional mages were forced to either join arcane factories as workers or face marginalization. Pushed toward the fringes of society, their timeless practices frowned upon and misunderstood, seen as backwards and barbaric. 

Meanwhile, many Churches of the Great Spirits preach doom if the use of Cerulium continues at its current rate. Some maintain a cold war with the government of Pharousia claiming divine rights in wielding their spirit magic; while others, such as Church of Ashur, collaborate to be recognize as a national religion and use it as an opportunity to weaken other churches and magic practitioners. 

Amidst this discordance grew organizations shadowed from public view—secret societies like the Seekers aiming to preserve magics and ensure peace amidst chaos; dark cults of mysterious entities drawing disillusioned souls into their malevolent embrace. 

The city streets already have enough to be worried about. A resurgence in abominations—entities born from corrupted spirits—and rogue mages seeking vengeance or power stoked fears across the nation. The once rare disturbances became ominously commonplace, spurring whispers that some agency beyond mere human error was at play. 

> [!pf2note|ttl-c] How "High Magic" is Erythea?
> It is important to note that Erythea, much like some of her spellpunk cousins, is more of a **wide** magic setting than a high magic one. 
> 
> While magic that bring daily convenience is commonplace, extremely powerful spells—such as long-distance, planar, and temporal travel—are merely fairytales due to the intrinsic properties of magic and reality in Erythea. Similarly, while resurrection might be a familiar fantasy, it remains beyond reach even for the most experienced mages and oracles. 
> 
> While village witches might know how to heal the sick, pray for rain, tell the fortune, they don't necessarily always get an definite response. Legendary wizards of national epics who said to command weather and call forth disasters are incredibly rare, as it requires impeccable training and divine favor to commune with Great Spirits at a level that could result in such high-level magical effect.
> <p style="align-content:center;font-weight:700;margin-top:2em">What Does This Mean For Me?</p>
> 
> Mechanically, this means a few spells might not be legal or seen as incredibly Rare or Unique in this campaign. You can find out more information about magic options and their rarity in the chapter of [[00 Player Guide/Character Creation#Magic & Faith\|Creating Character: Magic & Faith]].
> 
> It also means that the high-rank spellcasting rarely would be available to NPCs. For example, in a level 14 settlement like Ambrose, you would only find spellcasting services up to 4th-rank spells (as supposed to 7th-rank spells according to PF2 RAW).

### The Seekers of Pharousia

The Seekers is an ancient order devoted to protecting the realm from rogue magic and malevolent entities. For centuries, they have honed their skills in spellcraft and combat to meet each new supernatural threat. Though chapters span kingdoms and borders, their duty remains the same - to wield magic responsibly and solve mysteries beyond mortal ken.

Toward the start of the campaign, you and your party members arrived at the the Seekers' chapter quarters in Pharousia. The unique background options in Chapter [[01 Backgrounds\|Creating Character: Backgrounds]] present a handful of reason your PC might have been scouted, recruited, or invited as help. While you aren't required to choose one of these backgrounds, your character's backstory should involve some reason that the Seekers have reached out to you to join their ranks. 

In the revolutionized Pharousia, the Seekers stand at a crossroads. For centuries, they guarded the civilians against supernatural threats, but you come to the Seekers' Pharousia chapter in a time of change. 

Not long ago, Seekers were branded outlaws along with many other unofficial mages, in an effort to secure the means of magic by the Crown. After some very specific targeted sweep and a series of tragedy in the recent surge of abominations, Seekers’ ranks in Ambrose suffered severely. But the tides have turned with the support of the new Sovereign; he even granted Seekers the official access and guardianship of the Vault of Wonders, a chamber full of confiscated artifacts. Of course, this gift comes with strings attached - oversight from the Crown, where their activities and the vault closely monitored.

As a new Seeker pledge, you will train under the fair and capable Chapter Master Viola Whytebourne, said to have slain a thousand horrors in her time. She has reluctantly accepted oversight from the Crown's representatives to secure the order's future. Together with new allies, you must navigate political tensions while investigating the rising mystical threats.

### Ambrose at a Glance
The PCs begin this campaign in Ambrose, one of the important location to the discovery and industrialization of Cerulium technologies in the Sovereignty of Pharousia, by the north-eastern coasts of Elbon. 
While the adventures might lead you outside of the city, the majority of the first arc would provide you with ample opportunity to explore the city that birthed Arcane Revolution. Whether your character is Ambrose-born, a first- or second-generation immigrant, or a total newcomer, it's worthwhile to master some of the basic nomenclature in the Cerulean City.

#### Ambrose in Pharousia
While Ambrose is not the capital of Pharousia, it has since become the country's most important industrial center of progress and innovation. Following the various Cerulium inventions, Silverthorn Arcane Institute of Ambrose has since become one of the most prominent arcane academies in the world, surpassing even the Emberon Royal Conservatory in Casdim, the Capital of Pharousia. 

To name a few inventions that was conceived in the Cerulean City - Cerulium carriage that levitates in the air with magical wheels, mechanical servants and companions that follows simple command,  telescope that sees far into the horizon. Silverthorn also has the most authority on Cerulium transportation - such as trains and airship. 

Other than being the center of Cerulium industry, Ambrose has also become a cosmopolitan city since the revolution. Flooded with arcane scholars and workers seeking opportunities, the metropolis grows exponentially in the last five years to keep up with the immigrant from around the Pharousia and the greater region. The constant territorial conflicts between [[Novaheim\|Novaheim Empire]] and its neighboring nations has always been a constant source of immigrants and refugees for Pharousia, and many of them now came to Ambrose seeking a new life. 

Ambrose sits along the roaring Morrowind River. A network of canals feeds water into factory machineries while allowing goods to be shipped efficiently. Its major exports are Cerulium technology, Cerulium ore, fish, and culture in the form of entertainment and art.

#### Skyspire
The Sovereign Illya Aulorian has recently started a national construction project called the Skyspires, a network of artifice towers built with the greatest fruits of Cerulium technology that could be used to transmit sensory information - like image and sound. (Yes, they are building cell towers. )  
Ambrose will see the first tower of its kind, while more subsequent towers will be built around the nation.
