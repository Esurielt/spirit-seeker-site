A rare and valuable mineral, Cerulium has garnered significant attention from [[z_Glossary/Arcane Magic\|Arcane]] scientists for its unique properties. When subjected to specific processes and stablized in an Cerulium Box, the power stone can be temporarily charged, allowing it to act as a conduit for magical forces.

Often utilized as a replacement for traditional magical practitioners, Cerulium-powered devices enable widespread application of magical principles, transforming the daily life in cities. Due to its widespread use, Cerulium has become a symbol of innovation and industrialization in the [[z_Glossary/Arcane Magic\|Arcane]] Revolution, leading to substantial changes in societal hierarchy and metropolitan landscapes.
