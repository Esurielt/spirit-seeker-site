A ancient secret society of abomination hunters who wield swords and sorcery to protect the civilians against supernatural threats and to maintain the balance of the spirits.

Hunters of [[z_Glossary/abomination\|abomination]]s, the Seeker is an ancient organization that swear to protect the populace from the shadow and maintain the delicate balance between the mortal and ethereal realm. Each seeker agent has their unique skill sets and their unique encounters with the unseen forces. 

The Seekers has chapters scattered around the world. In [[01 World of Erythea/Atlas/Eblon/Pharousia/Azur-Aulihrun\|Azur-Aulihrun]], the Pharousian Seeker chapter is currently led by Chapter Master [[Viola Whytebourne\|Viola Whytebourne]]. The organization is accepting sponsorship from the local government in this desperate time - a move that might be frowned upon by many the traditionalists in the organization. Outside of the sponsorship, the organization operates behind a disguised front - [[z_Glossary/Azure Quill\|Azure Quill]], a local news and private investigation agency.
