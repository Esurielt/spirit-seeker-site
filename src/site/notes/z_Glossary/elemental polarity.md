Also known as the "Air" or "Qi", describe the flow of [[z_Glossary/element\|element]]s, also a scale that can be used to measure an element's degree of activity. The most common names include: [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Solais]] vs. [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Noxis]], [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Yang]] vs. [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Yin]], [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Celestial]] vs. [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Terrestrial]].

When a cluster of aether presents more gaseous, active, or spiritual, it leans toward Solais (or Yang, Celestial). When more solid, dormant, or earthbound, it leans toward Noxis (or Yin, Terrestrial). 

For example, a storm could be Solais Water aligned, and flood could be Noxis Water aligned. 

##### elemental cycle 
Elements tends to mix with others, feed or counter other elements based on the [[z_Glossary/elemental cycle\|cycle of elements]]. When aether of various elements mix with each other, they also shift its polarity - becoming more "gaseous and spiritual" or more "solid and material." This is also called the Qi (meaning Air) or the flow of element.  

Each element have its own preferred polarity that we often associate with its default state: 
Solais - Wood, Fire
Noxis - Earth, Metal, Water

When an element counters another, the elements often turns into a different polarity, with the exception of Earth and Water. When an element topple over to its opposite polarity, it would feeds into its adjacent element , the fed element usually turns more Solais - stronger and more active. 

For example: 
 - Counter: when Fire meets Metal, both the Fire aether and the Metal aether would change its polarity - the Metal would become more Solais and be able to be bent and worked, or combine with Solais aether of other elements, while the Fire aether becomes more Noxis and weaker. 
 - Feed: When Metal becomes highly Solais - opposite from its usual Noxis nature, it becomes highly conductive and might attract or produce Solais Water in the process of combining with aether of other elements - such as lighting effects.
