Also known as the "Air" or "Qi", describe the flow of [[z_Glossary/element\|element]]s, also a scale that can be used to measure an element's degree of activity in the elemental cycle. The most common names include: [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Solais]] vs. [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Noxis]], [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Yang]] vs. [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Yin]], [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Celestial]] vs. [[z_Glossary/elemental polarity\|Terrestrial]].

When a cluster of aether presents more gaseous or spiritual, it leans toward Solais (or Yang, Celestial). When more solid and earthbound, it leans toward Noxis (or Yin, Terrestrial). 

For example, a storm could be Solais Water aligned, and flood could be Noxis Water aligned. 

##### elemental cycle 
When an element counters another, the countered element usually turns more Noxis. When an element feeds another, the fed element usually turns more Solais.
