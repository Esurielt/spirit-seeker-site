A magical artifact created by the [[z_Glossary/Emissaries of Starkeeper\|Emissaries of Starkeeper]]. The Spectral Lamp is designed to capture the essence of malevolent beings, known as abominations, within a contained space, effectively rendering them harmless.

Spectral Lantern looks like a metal frame caged with one-sided glass, with a piece of gem wired to suspense in the middle. It seems very similar to a Cerulium Box - however, it has longer history than the Arcane innovation. 

Utilizing a delicate balance of magical forces, the Spectral Lamp effectively isolates the abomination's aether inside the glass chamber, preventing it from causing further harm or corruption. Once trapped, the aether can be studied, potentially offering insights into the nature of abominations and their creation. 

By trapping the twisted essence of these beings, the [[z_Glossary/Emissaries of Starkeeper\|Emissaries]] aim to prevent further chaos and disruption in the fabric of reality. They generously donate this artifacts to other magic organization or individuals like the [[z_Glossary/Seeker\|Seeker]]s as long as they return the lantern to be kept safely in their sealed vault.
