---

A being twisted by the influence of unnatural aether, often exhibiting monstrous physical characteristics and unpredictable behavior. Abominations are typically a result of uncontrolled magic or corrupted spirits.

They pose a significant threat to the natural order and the balance of reality. The presence of an abomination can indicate disruption of the [[z_Glossary/Lifestream\|Lifestream]] and further cause chaos in the fabric of reality. Abominations are often unstable, highly aggressive, and should be approached with caution. They are often mixed with [[z_Glossary/specter\|specter]]s as both are threatening magical creatures to civilians. 

Abominations and specters can be neutralized then captured using the [[z_Glossary/Spectral Lantern\|Spectral Lantern]].
